# Error Handling

The Aster Policy Engine uses standard HTTP status codes and a consistent JSON response envelope for all error conditions.

## Standard Error Response Format

All error responses — whether from the application layer or from policy evaluation failures — use the following structure:

```json
{
  "result": null,
  "error": "Human-readable description of the error",
  "executionTimeMs": 0
}
```

| Field             | Type           | Description                                                     |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `result`          | null           | Always `null` when an error occurs                              |
| `error`           | string         | A human-readable message describing what went wrong             |
| `executionTimeMs` | number         | Elapsed time in milliseconds; `0` for errors detected pre-execution |

::: tip Distinguishing evaluation errors from HTTP errors
HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes indicate infrastructure-level failures (missing headers, authorization, server fault). An HTTP `200` response with a non-null `error` field indicates that the policy was parsed and dispatched successfully but the evaluation itself produced an error (e.g., a runtime exception inside the rule logic).

## HTTP Status Codes

### 400 Bad Request

Returned when the request is structurally invalid or is missing required information.

**Common causes:**

| Scenario                           | Example `error` message                                      |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing `X-Tenant-Id` header       | `"X-Tenant-Id header is required"`                           |
| Invalid `X-Tenant-Id` format       | `"X-Tenant-Id must match ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$"`            |
| Missing `Content-Type` header      | `"Content-Type must be application/json"`                    |
| Malformed JSON body                | `"Request body could not be parsed as JSON"`                 |
| Missing required body field        | `"Field 'functionName' is required"`                         |

**Example — missing tenant header:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://policy.aster-lang.dev/api/v1/policies/evaluate-source \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "...", "functionName": "greet", "context": {}, "locale": "en-US"}'
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

{
  "result": null,
  "error": "X-Tenant-Id header is required",
  "executionTimeMs": 0
}
```

### 403 Forbidden

Returned when the caller lacks the required permissions for the requested operation.

**Common causes:**

| Scenario                                  | Example `error` message                                    |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `X-User-Role` too low for the endpoint    | `"Role VIEWER is insufficient; MEMBER required"`           |
| Invalid or expired HMAC signature         | `"HMAC signature verification failed"`                     |
| Timestamp outside the 5-minute window     | `"Request timestamp is outside the acceptable window"`     |
| Nonce already used within replay window   | `"Nonce has already been used; possible replay attack"`    |

**Example — insufficient role:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://policy.aster-lang.dev/api/v1/policies/evaluate-source \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-Id: my-tenant" \
  -H "X-User-Role: VIEWER" \
  -d '{"source": "...", "functionName": "greet", "context": {}, "locale": "en-US"}'
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

{
  "result": null,
  "error": "Role VIEWER is insufficient; MEMBER required",
  "executionTimeMs": 0
}
```

### 404 Not Found

Returned when a referenced resource (e.g., a stored policy ID) does not exist within the current tenant's scope.

```json
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

{
  "result": null,
  "error": "Policy 'pricing-v3' not found for tenant 'my-tenant'",
  "executionTimeMs": 0
}
```

### 429 Too Many Requests

Returned when the tenant has exceeded its rate limit. The response includes a `Retry-After` header.

```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 30
```

```json
{
  "result": null,
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded; retry after 30 seconds",
  "executionTimeMs": 0
}
```

### 500 Internal Server Error

Returned for unexpected server-side failures. These errors are automatically logged and should be reported to support if they persist.

```json
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error

{
  "result": null,
  "error": "An unexpected error occurred. Reference ID: a3f9c2d1",
  "executionTimeMs": 0
}
```

::: warning If you receive a 500
Note the `Reference ID` in the error message and include it when contacting support. It uniquely identifies the log entry for your request.
:::

## Evaluation-Level Errors (HTTP 200 with `error` non-null)

Even when a request is structurally valid and authorised, the policy evaluation itself may fail. In these cases the HTTP status code is `200` but the response body has a non-null `error` field.

**Common causes:**

| Scenario                                    | Example `error` message                                         |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Syntax error in CNL source                  | `"Parse error at line 3: unexpected token 'produce'"`           |
| Function name not found in policy           | `"Rule 'calculate' not found in module 'pricing'"`              |
| Type mismatch in context input              | `"Expected Number for parameter 'amount', got String"`          |
| Runtime exception inside rule logic         | `"Division by zero in rule 'split-cost' at line 7"`             |
| Locale not supported                        | `"Unsupported locale 'fr-FR'"`                                  |

**Example — rule not found:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://policy.aster-lang.dev/api/v1/policies/evaluate-source \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-Id: my-tenant" \
  -H "X-User-Role: MEMBER" \
  -d '{
    "source": "Module demo.\n\nRule greet given name as Text, produce Text:\n  Return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\".",
    "context": {"name": "World"},
    "functionName": "farewell",
    "locale": "en-US"
  }'
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "result": null,
  "error": "Rule 'farewell' not found in module 'demo'",
  "executionTimeMs": 5
}
```

## Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Always check both the HTTP status code and the `error` field.** A `200` response does not guarantee a successful evaluation.

2. **Implement retry logic for `429` and `500` responses.** Use the `Retry-After` header for rate-limit errors and exponential backoff for server errors.

3. **Do not retry `400` or `403` responses without fixing the underlying cause.** These errors indicate a client-side issue that will not resolve on its own.

4. **For batch evaluations**, inspect each item in the `results` array individually — a failure in one item does not affect the others.
