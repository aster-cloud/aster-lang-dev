Welcome. This is the first post on the Aster Lang blog.

## Why we're starting a blog

Most of our documentation answers **"how do I use feature X?"** That's the right shape for a reference site, but it leaves a lot of useful conversations on the cutting-room floor:

- **Why** we designed something the way we did.
- **Where** we got the trade-off wrong and what we changed.
- **What** we learned from customers running policies in production.

That's what this space is for.

## Who we're writing for

Three audiences, in rough order of frequency:

1. **Policy authors** — compliance officers, risk analysts, anyone writing Aster Lang rules. Expect posts on rule design patterns, common pitfalls, and language deep dives.
2. **Engineers** — anyone integrating the engine into a service. Expect posts on architecture, performance, and the boring-but-important parts of GraalVM Native Image.
3. **Decision-makers** — anyone choosing between Aster Lang and an alternative. Expect posts on why the language looks the way it does and what we mean by "auditable by default."

## A taste

Here's a rule that compiles and runs the same way in English, 中文, and Deutsch:

```aster
Module aster.example.greet.

Rule greet given name, produce Text:
    Return "Hello, " + name.
```

If the multi-language angle is new to you, the [CNL Quick Reference](/learn/cnl-quick-reference) is a good next stop.

## What's coming

A few posts already drafted, queued for the coming weeks:

- **Controlled natural language vs. DSL** — why Aster reads like a memo on purpose.
- **Lexicon packs** — how to ship Aster Lang in a fourth language without writing Java.
- **Why Truffle** — the boring engine choices that make the playground fast.
- **Decision traces in production** — what we ship in `?trace=true` and why.
