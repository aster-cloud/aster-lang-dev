# GraphQL API Overview

The Aster Policy Engine exposes a GraphQL API for querying and managing policies. It is built on **SmallRye GraphQL** (the MicroProfile GraphQL implementation) and offers the full suite of MicroProfile GraphQL features including built-in introspection, type safety, and a hosted schema endpoint.

## Endpoint

| Purpose | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Query / Mutation execution | `POST /graphql` |
| Schema (SDL) | `GET /graphql/schema.graphql` |

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <token>` | Yes |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Yes |
| `X-Tenant-Id` | Tenant identifier string | Yes |
| `Idempotency-Key` | Client-generated unique string (UUID recommended) | Mutations only |

::: tip Idempotency-Key
Providing an `Idempotency-Key` on mutation requests ensures that retrying a failed or timed-out request does not apply the operation a second time. The server caches the mutation result keyed on this value for 24 hours. This header is optional but strongly recommended for write operations.

## Request Format

All requests must be HTTP `POST` with a JSON body conforming to the GraphQL over HTTP specification:

```json
{
  "query": "query { ... }",
  "variables": {},
  "operationName": "OptionalOperationName"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | `string` | Yes | GraphQL document containing the operation to execute. |
| `variables` | `object` | No | Named variable values referenced in the `query`. |
| `operationName` | `string` | No | Disambiguates which operation to run when `query` contains multiple named operations. |

## Response Format

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "errors": []
}
```

A `200 OK` HTTP status is returned for all well-formed GraphQL responses, including partial successes. Always inspect the `errors` array — a non-empty value indicates that one or more field resolvers encountered an error, even when `data` is partially populated.

## Schema

Download the full schema in SDL format:

::: code-group

```bash [curl]
curl -X GET https://policy.aster-lang.dev/graphql/schema.graphql \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Error Handling

GraphQL errors follow the [GraphQL specification error format](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Errors):

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Policy not found",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["getPolicy"],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "NOT_FOUND",
        "classification": "DataFetchingException"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Extension Field | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `code` | Machine-readable error code (e.g. `NOT_FOUND`, `FORBIDDEN`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`). |
| `classification` | SmallRye GraphQL error classification. |

## HTTP Status Codes

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `200 OK` | GraphQL response returned (check `errors` for partial failures). |
| `400 Bad Request` | Request body is not valid JSON or the GraphQL document is syntactically invalid. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid bearer token. |
| `403 Forbidden` | Token is valid but the caller lacks the required role for the requested operation. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Unexpected engine failure before the GraphQL layer could respond. |
