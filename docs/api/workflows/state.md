# Workflow State

Retrieve the current materialized state of a workflow. The state is derived from the workflow's event log and may be supplemented by a periodic snapshot to accelerate reads. Use this endpoint when you need the latest status and result without fetching the full event history.

## Endpoint

`GET /api/v1/workflows/{workflowId}/state`

## Required Role

`MEMBER`

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <token>` | Yes |
| `X-Tenant-ID` | Tenant identifier string | Yes |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `workflowId` | `string` | The unique identifier of the workflow. |

## Response Body

```json
{
  "workflowId": "wf-abc123",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "lastEventSeq": 5,
  "result": {
    "eligible": true,
    "approvedAmount": 25000
  },
  "snapshot": {
    "intermediateState": "..."
  },
  "snapshotSeq": 3,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:29:58Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:01Z"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `workflowId` | `string` | Unique identifier of the workflow. |
| `status` | `string` | Current lifecycle status. See [Status Values](#status-values) below. |
| `lastEventSeq` | `integer` | Sequence number of the most recently applied event. |
| `result` | `any \| null` | Final output produced by the workflow. Populated once `status` reaches a terminal state (`COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `COMPENSATED`, `COMPENSATION_FAILED`). `null` for non-terminal workflows. |
| `snapshot` | `object \| null` | Opaque intermediate state snapshot used to accelerate event replay. `null` if no snapshot has been taken yet. |
| `snapshotSeq` | `integer \| null` | Sequence number at which the snapshot was taken. `null` when `snapshot` is `null`. |
| `createdAt` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp when the workflow was created. |
| `updatedAt` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp of the most recent state change. |

## Status Values

| Status | Terminal | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `READY` | No | Workflow has been created but not yet started. |
| `RUNNING` | No | Workflow is actively executing. |
| `COMPLETED` | Yes | Workflow finished successfully. `result` is populated. |
| `FAILED` | Yes | Workflow terminated due to an unrecoverable error. |
| `COMPENSATING` | No | Workflow is executing compensation (rollback) steps. |
| `COMPENSATED` | Yes | Compensation completed successfully. |
| `COMPENSATION_FAILED` | Yes | Compensation steps also failed. Manual intervention may be required. |

## HTTP Status Codes

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `200 OK` | Request succeeded. Returns the current workflow state. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid bearer token. |
| `403 Forbidden` | Token is valid but the caller lacks the `MEMBER` role, or the workflow belongs to a different tenant. |
| `404 Not Found` | No workflow found with the given `workflowId`. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Unexpected engine failure. |

```

```js [JavaScript]
const workflowId = 'wf-abc123';
const response = await fetch(
  `https://policy.aster-lang.dev/api/v1/workflows/${workflowId}/state`,
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer <token>',
      'X-Tenant-ID': 'acme-corp',
    },
  }
);

const state = await response.json();

if (state.status === 'COMPLETED') {
  console.log('Workflow result:', state.result);
} else if (state.status === 'FAILED') {
  console.error('Workflow failed. Last event sequence:', state.lastEventSeq);
}
