# Workflow Events

Retrieve the ordered sequence of events that make up a workflow's execution history. Events are the fundamental unit of the workflow event-sourcing model — the current state of any workflow can always be reconstructed by replaying its event log from the beginning.

## Endpoint

`GET /api/v1/workflows/{workflowId}/events`

## Required Role

`MEMBER`

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <token>` | Yes |
| `X-Tenant-ID` | Tenant identifier string | Yes |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `workflowId` | `string` | The unique identifier of the workflow. |

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `fromSeq` | `integer` | No | Return only events with a sequence number greater than or equal to this value. Defaults to `0` (all events). Use this to poll for new events after a known position without re-fetching the full history. |

## Response Body

The response is a JSON array of event objects, ordered by sequence number ascending.

```json
[
  {
    "sequence": 1,
    "workflowId": "wf-abc123",
    "eventType": "WORKFLOW_STARTED",
    "payload": {},
    "occurredAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  {
    "sequence": 2,
    "workflowId": "wf-abc123",
    "eventType": "POLICY_EVALUATED",
    "payload": {
      "policyModule": "Loan.Approval",
      "policyFunction": "isEligible",
      "result": true,
      "executionTimeMs": 6
    },
    "occurredAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  {
    "sequence": 3,
    "workflowId": "wf-abc123",
    "eventType": "WORKFLOW_COMPLETED",
    "payload": {
      "finalResult": true
    },
    "occurredAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:01Z"
  }
]
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `sequence` | `integer` | Monotonically increasing sequence number within the workflow. Gaps indicate missing or compacted events. |
| `workflowId` | `string` | Identifier of the owning workflow (mirrors the path parameter). |
| `eventType` | `string` | Event classification (e.g. `WORKFLOW_STARTED`, `POLICY_EVALUATED`, `WORKFLOW_COMPLETED`, `COMPENSATION_STARTED`). |
| `payload` | `object` | Event-specific data. Structure varies by `eventType`. |
| `occurredAt` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp when the event was recorded. |

## HTTP Status Codes

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `200 OK` | Request succeeded. Returns an array (may be empty if `fromSeq` is beyond the last recorded event). |
| `400 Bad Request` | Malformed `fromSeq` parameter. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid bearer token. |
| `403 Forbidden` | Token is valid but the caller lacks the `MEMBER` role, or the workflow belongs to a different tenant. |
| `404 Not Found` | No workflow found with the given `workflowId`. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Unexpected engine failure. |

```bash [curl]
# Fetch all events for a workflow
curl -X GET "https://policy.aster-lang.dev/api/v1/workflows/wf-abc123/events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: acme-corp"

# Poll for new events after sequence 42
curl -X GET "https://policy.aster-lang.dev/api/v1/workflows/wf-abc123/events?fromSeq=43" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: acme-corp"
```

```js [JavaScript]
const workflowId = 'wf-abc123';

// Fetch all events
const response = await fetch(
  `https://policy.aster-lang.dev/api/v1/workflows/${workflowId}/events`,
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer <token>',
      'X-Tenant-ID': 'acme-corp',
    },
  }
);

const events = await response.json();

// Poll for new events after a known sequence
async function pollNewEvents(workflowId, lastSeq) {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({ fromSeq: String(lastSeq + 1) });
  const res = await fetch(
    `https://policy.aster-lang.dev/api/v1/workflows/${workflowId}/events?${params}`,
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer <token>',
        'X-Tenant-ID': 'acme-corp',
      },
